# Rock Paper Scissors Project



This is the first project to actually use the functions of javascript to create a simple, web-based rock, paper, scissors game. 
The directions from the ODIN project curriculum can be viewd [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors?ref=lnav).

Overall, this project went smoothly. I often had to view previous projects to get an understanding of how to keep track of the score. A simple
tally up to 5 points was not difficult to add into the playRound() function. 

The most challenging aspect I had was understanding all of the DOM methods, as they have not been taught up to this point in the curriculum. 
appendChild() and addEventListener() were critical for the success of this script.

Of note, an arrow function was used as the addEventListener function, which inititiated two more inner functions: playRound() and chkPts().
